MDJM Event Management is an interface to fully manage your DJ/Events or Agency business efficiently.

== Description ==

MDJM Event Management is the solution for Mobile DJ's who work on their own or businesses that employ multiple DJ's.

It is an event planning solution built specifically for websites running on WordPress ensuring the users are familiar with the Administration settings and look and feel.

MDJM Event Management allows you to manage your events from enquiry stage through to completion. Add your DJ's, your clients and then create an event.

As a site admin you will be able to view all information, but as a DJ, depending on the permissions set by the Administrator, you will only see those events that are specific to you.

Email automation is also built in, depending on your chosen settings. Quotes can be automatically sent to clients when an event is created, contracts can be issued automatically and digitally signed, and booking confirmations also emailed to both clients and DJ's alike.

As a client, you gain access to a number of features via the main website once you login. These include;
*	Profile management ensuring that the DJ has all the relevant contact details at all times
*	Playlist management
*	Secure online payments via PayPal
*	Digitally sign event contracts
*	Invite guests to add songs to the playlist via a unique URL. Clients can remove songs they do not deem appropriate

The main dashboard provides a complete overview of your business detailing the number of events and earnings over the month and year.

All in all MDJM Event Management helps you to run your DJ business efficiently.

	* No PayPal account is needed by Clients in order to make payments
	* Accepts payments from all major credit cards, as well as funds within the Client's PayPal account
	* Clients can choose to pay the Booking Fee/Deposit, or the full event balance

**Transaction Page**
A new Transactions page has been added to the MDJM system and is available via the MDJM Event Management menu's within the WordPress admin interface.

This page is only available to Admins and if the Payment features is enabled and has been introduced to compliment the new online payments system as described above.

For now, the page simply lists any transactions that have been processed via PayPal and any other data relevant to that transaction. We will continue to develop this feature in up and coming versions.

**Events Table**<br />
The Events page has been updated slightly to be a little more intuitive. Unattended enquiries are now listed as priority and with a red background.

The majority of updates to this page were to do with better, cleaner coding resulting in faster loading times and more efficient lookups.
